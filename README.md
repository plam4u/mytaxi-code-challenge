Using:
- Xcode Version 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)
- CocoaPod 1.3

Possible next steps:
- refactor to MVVM
- work in TDD (depends on the time limitations)
- refactor code style
- add StatefulViewController for handling view states such as loading, empty, etc... (https://github.com/aschuch/StatefulViewController)
- map pin icons
- add animations
